It combines pioneering technologies to provide unparalleled security and sustainability to decentralized applications, systems, and societies.
        With a leading team of engineers, Cardano exists to redistribute power from unaccountable structures to the margins - to individuals - and be an enabling force for positive change and progress.`,

      title: 'What is Finbyte?',

      title: 'How to Login to Finbyte?',
      text: `To log in to Finbyte, there's just one main requirement: you need to be using a web browser that supports installing extensionsâ€”like most desktop browsers (Chrome, Brave, Firefox, etc.). In addition, you'll need a Cardano-compatible browser wallet (also known as a light wallet) that can connect to DApps. Once everything is set up, simply head over to Finbyte and click the Connect button. It's really that easy.`,

      title: 'How is it free?',
      text: `Finbyte is completely free to use because we believe in building open, accessible tools for the Cardano community. While there are behind-the-scenes costs to keep the platform running, we cover those so that you don't have to. Instead of relying on traditional logins or subscriptions, we use Cardano's CIP-8 standard to verify actions on the platform. This means your wallet signs any important activity (like creating a post, liking something, or tipping) helping us ensure authenticity without needing passwords, emails, or invasive tracking. Our goal is to provide a seamless, secure experience powered entirely by your wallet connection. You get full functionality with zero fees or hidden charges.`,
